# EV-Sales-Analysis-Using-Python
Analyzing data on electric vehicle (EV) sales can provide valuable insights into the adoption and market trends of electric vehicles. Here's an outline of a data analytics project on EV sales:

Descriptive Analysis:
a. Overall EV Sales Trends: Analyze the overall trends in EV sales over time in different countries. Calculate descriptive statistics and visualize the sales patterns using bar charts and line charts.
b. Market Share Analysis: Analyze the market share of different EV models or manufacturers. Identify leading brands or models and visualize market share using bar charts and pie charts.
c. Geographic Analysis: Analyze EV sales patterns across different geographic regions or countries. Identify regions with high EV adoption rates and investigate factors contributing to regional variations. 

EV Model Analysis:
a. Model Performance: Analyze the performance of specific EV models in terms of sales volume, market share, or growth rates. Identify successful models and factors contributing to their success. Visualize model performance using bar charts, line charts, or bubble plots.
b. Price Analysis: Analyze the relationship between EV prices and sales volumes. Explore price elasticity and identify price points that drive higher sales. Visualize price-sales relationships using scatter plots.

Factors Influencing EV Sales:
a. Charging Infrastructure: Analyze the relationship between the availability of charging infrastructure and EV sales. Identify regions with better-charging infrastructure and their impact on sales. Visualize this relationship using maps or scatter plots.
b. Range and Battery Technology: Analyze the impact of EV range and battery technology advancements on sales. Explore the relationship between range and sales volumes. Visualize range-sales relationships using scatter plots or line charts. 

These are the NBViewer Jupyter Notebooks link for all the notebooks. Some graphs or charts which are created using plotly library are supported by GitHub. Therefore, to check all the graphs please open these links.
